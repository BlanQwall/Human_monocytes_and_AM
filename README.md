 Hello Thomas and Maude, 
 If you can see this page, that means you have accepted to collaborate on the project. This is still private project that no one has access to but the invited people. 
 You will not need to do anything. I will progressively purge the codes and render them into PDF. Some of these steps has alread been done. 
 The final project will be released to public once paper done. 
 
 Notice: 
 - This GitHub project is supposed to deposit the source codes. Not all the intermediate data are available in GitHub project. However, some intermediate data, such as the individual sample under Rds object files, are available as resource data on the NCBI GEO database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE183974).
