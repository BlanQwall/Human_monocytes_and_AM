abstract: |
  Alveolar macrophages (AM) are functionally important innate cells involved in lung homeostasis and immunity. While the idea that AM merely represent a homogenous population has been recently challenged, it remains unclear whether ontogenically and functionally distinct subpopulations of AMs can be found in healthy human lungs, and to what extent conditions like smoking or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) trigger changes in the AM compartment. Here, we analyzed bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells from healthy non-smokers, healthy smokers and COPD patients by flow cytometry, bulk and single-cell(sc) RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). We found that BALF CD206+ macrophage subpopulations could be distinguished based on their level of auto-fluorescence. Bulk RNA-seq analysis of blood monocytes, CD206+ autofluorescentlow (AFlo) and AFhi macrophages supported that AFlo macrophages derived from monocytes that were imprinted by the alveolar niche to differentiate into AM expressing both monocyte- and AM-related genes. ScRNA-seq analyses performed on total BALF cells from the same patients highlighted the dual monocytic and self-proliferative origin of AM, as well as the functional diversity of the AM pool in healthy and COPD lungs. Of note, monocyte-derived AFlo AM were equally represented in each category of subjects and exhibited an immunoregulatory profile, including the ability to secrete the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin(IL-10). Finally, we provide evidence that the monocyte-associated marker CCR2 can be used by flow cytometry to distinguish AM according to their origin, thereby opening new perspectives to better understand AM complexity and functions in different contexts, such as infections, inflammatory disorders or cancer.
